# About
The Pyxis is a First-Person Puzzle, Sci-Fi game developed by me. Produced by Griffith University. Currently, the game is just a micro experience of what's to come.

# Story
You wake up alone on an AI-maintained generation ship. With only a robotic companion as your guide, you must solve complex puzzles and make impossible decisions to ensure humanityâ€™s survival.
All while your sanity is slipping through your fingers. The core experience is a haunting journey of isolation, intellect, and moral weight, where every choice shapes the fate of a species adrift among the stars.
